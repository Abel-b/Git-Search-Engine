<h1>GitHub</h1>
<hr>
<p>GitHub is a website and service that we hear geeks rave about all the time, yet a lot of people don’t really
    understand what it does. Want to know what all the GitHub hubbub is about? Read on to find out.</p>
<p>Git is a version control system, similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes GitHub so
    special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the
    hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.</p>

<h3>Repository</h3>
    <p>A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored.
